# LAB_3_DIGITAL_II

This project was centered around using the PIC16F887 microcontroller with the XC8 compiler in MPLABX.
It was made of 3 main parts:
1. A routine which obtains the voltage value from two potentiometers. Each one simulated two analog sensors and their values were displayed on a LCD screen.
its 8-bit library to initialize the LCD.

2. A stable USART communication with the computer to display in the serial port the analog values.

3. Lastly, send from the computer the characters "+" or "-" to increase or decrease a counter value also displayed in the same LCD screen.
